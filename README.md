#General notes

I started off trying to be quite lightweight - but I think I should've included a store from the beginning, I ended up leaning towards that when I started running out of time.
1,2,5 out of the 5 outputs are done, but I've not done the filtering by rating or genre.  I started working on the Genre filtering but it's commented out.
There's a few tests there but it's not exhaustive, and they're broken (because of imports).
